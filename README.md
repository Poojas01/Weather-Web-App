# Weather-Web-App
I developed a **Weather Web App** using **HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3** to fetch and display real-time weather data. **HTML5** structured the webpage with an input field and a results section. **JavaScript** handled API integration using `fetch()`, dynamically updating weather details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. **CSS3** enhanced the design with **Flexbox, animations, and media queries** for responsiveness. **Event listeners** improved user interaction, while **local storage** saved recent searches. This project strengthened my skills in **API handling, DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design**, delivering an engaging and functional weather app. 🌤️🚀
